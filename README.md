// The "All for One" Assignment is a comprehensive project that consolidates the mini API endpoints challenges into a 10-page web application. The focus of this assignment is to build out the front end using Tailwind CSS, creating a user-friendly interface for each API endpoint.
// No azure account yet so hosted on localhost

// Peer Comment : I'm not able to test your endpoints since you don't have azure yet, but the design is nice. When compared to your figma, your desktop elements are a lot smaller than you planned. I like that you enlarged the input fields, that looks better. I noticed that your buttons on the home page don't look centered though. On your mobile site, things look good, but I wish the home button was at the top of the page like it is on desktop rather than being at the bottom. It's also a little small. But otherwise, nice work! I really like your theme and how colorful it is. It's very fun. I wish I was able to test the endpoints.
